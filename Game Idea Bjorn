Game idea Bjorn	

My game idea is to make a version of gallica. Gallica is a game in which the player controls a space ship and shoots down the enemy aliens. Gallica has all the potential to be a suitable game for the project. 

The project has the following requirements:
-	The game has to be able to play coop
-	It needs to have transitions 
-	A high score system 
-	Being able to interact with the surroundings 
-	Having entityâ€™s that the player can interact with 

Gallica is a game which able to for fill all the requirements for the project but has also a lot of extra potential features for the game. For example adding special power ups which would give the player extra abilities. It will also be able to have bonuses like double points which give you twice more points then normal. In the coop mode there will be more enemies to shoot down to make it more difficult.
